            <p>
                I created this app becouse I was getting frustrated by how 
                complicated it was to keep track of my weekly budgets.
                I had a clear goal on how much i wanted to spend at max but 
                it was a constant chaos in keeping all my receipts or scrolling through 
                my bank account. That was when I thought: this can be way easier.
                And what I found even more important is that the app that I would create
                was transparrent so you can look up the code on github and you can check 
                what happends behind the scenes. <br>
                With that said go ahead: you can make an account, on the register page,
                or you can login on the login page
